# repo.events

Repo.Events shows you recent activities of a github repository, giving you a quick overview of what's happening in the 
github repository.

There is a **web app** and a **chrome extension**.

To use the web app, visit [repo.events](https://repo.events). As a shortcut, enter `repo.events/{owner}/{repo}` to your 
browser address bar to see activities from the repository immediately. For example [repo.events/golang/go](https://repo.events/golang/go) 
or [repo.events/apple/swift](https://repo.events/apple/swift).

The chrome extension add a "Activities" tab to the github repository page, so you can see activities of the repository 
without open a new browser tab. You can install the extension from [chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/repoevents/feffmdfhanmdkmeepnmcdpjagojedlol).
