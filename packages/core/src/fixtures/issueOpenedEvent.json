Please test using the latest version of the relevant\r\n  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nReact version: `18.3.0` (as seen in `ReactVersions.js`)\r\njest-react version: `0.15.0`\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. `git clone` the react repository `main` branch on Windows OS at date February 21, 2023.\r\n2. Run `yarn`\r\n3. Run `yarn test`\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't\r\n  have dependencies other than React. Issues without reproduction steps or\r\n  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nLink to code example:\r\nN/A, but I have attached the screenshot for your reference.\r\n\r\n![react yarn test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20269286/220316035-64e918c4-ebb3-4157-8063-b7e4b225154e.JPG)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Please provide a CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new), a link to a\r\n  repository on GitHub, or provide a minimal code example that reproduces the\r\n  problem. You may provide a screenshot of the application if you think it is\r\n  relevant to your bug report. Here are some tips for providing a minimal\r\n  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\nThis error occurs on WINDOWS OS ONLY, I tried to reproduce it in the Ubuntu system, and there _ALL_ test cases in the `yarn test` PASSED successfully. I tried to find similar issue in Issues List but did not find any.\r\n\r\nNote: I believe this bug can be more due to Windows OS / Powershell handling the code, but I thought of submitting an issue as I do not know the vulnerability or risk of the exploitation of this error.\r\n\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\nThe test should pass successfully in Windows OS since it passes successfully in Ubuntu OS.\r\n",
